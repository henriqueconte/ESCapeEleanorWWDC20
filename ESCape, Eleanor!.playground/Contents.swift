//: # ESCape, Eleanor! üïä
//:  by [Henrique Conte](https://github.com/henriqueconte)
/*:
 The usage of unusual and different technologies always fascinated me, so I decided to create a mini game showing a little bit of what we can do with the Touch Bar.
 
 
 Your objective will be to help Eleanor, a young and brave programmer to escape from the cave she ended while searching for exotic technologies. In order to do that, you will just have to:
 
 
 1. Show the Assistant Editor with the LiveView selected
 2. Run the Playground
 2. Click on the canvas to show the controls
 
 
 * Important:
 If your Macbook does not have a TouchBar, press ‚åò + ‚áß + 8
 
 ---
 
 ### Controls
 
 Use your arrow keys to walk ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ‚û°Ô∏è. More commands will be taught during the gameplay.
 
 
### Take a cup of coffee and let's start with the demo!
